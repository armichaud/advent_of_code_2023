Solved part 1

Part 1 was fairly simple to brute force. I didn't have time to move onto part 2 either way, but part of my reticence to jump into it was that my solution relies on the nalgebra matrix data structure, which I suspect will not be helpful when I have to treat the grid as a potentially infinitely repeating cycle.
