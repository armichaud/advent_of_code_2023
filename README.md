2023 was the first year I heard about (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com]. I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to practice Rust, develop my skills with algorithms and data structures, and tackle some fun coding challenges outside of work. As of now, I've got working code solutions for 17 full 2-part puzzles, with an additional 5 puzzles where I solved part 1, for a total of 39 out of 50 challenges. I've included a README for each problem with a (usually) brief explanation of my approach, what I learned, and where I got snagged.

I wasn't trying to get on the leaderboard, but the completionist in me wanted to try to solve every problem. Suffice it to say, I learned a ton, but I've come to the conclusion that there are diminishing returns to continuing to try and work through / debug solutions. Some of these challenges required techniques and mathematical concepts that I had never encountered before, so I'm comfortable setting them aside while I go learn more about the things I encountered while tackling these like linear algebra, binary heaps / sets, pathfinding algorithms, etc.

I may return and tackle the unfinished ones at some point. I also expect that someday, I'll have a fun time cleaning up what is surely overly verbose code when I understand Rust better, but for now this repo will just be a record for myself and anyone who is looking into me as a potential employee / project contributor.
